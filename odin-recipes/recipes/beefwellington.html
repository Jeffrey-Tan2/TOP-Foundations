<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef fillet</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Chestnut mushroom</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Fresh thyme</li>
        <li>Dry white wine</li>
        <li>Prosciutto</li>
        <li>Puff pastry</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Egg yolk</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 220C</li>
        <li>Sit beef fillet on a roasting tray. Brush with olive oil and season with pepper</li>
        <li>Roast for 15 mins for medium-rare, 20 mins for medium</li>
        <li>While beef is cooling, chop 250g chestnut mushrooms as finely as possible</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tbsp of olive oil and 50g of butter in large pan and fry the mushroom on medium heat with thyme for 10 mins, stirring often</li>
        <li>Season mushroom mixture, pour over 100ml dry white wine and cook for 10 mins until wine has absorbed</li>>
        <li>Remove the mushroom duxelle from the pan to cool and discard the thyme</li>
        <li>Overlap two pieces of cling film over a large chopping board. Lay 12 slices prosciutto on the cling film, slightly overlapping, in a double row</li>
        <li>Spread half the duxelles over the prosciutto, then sit the fillet on it and spread the remaining duxelles over</li>
        <li>Use the cling film’s edges to draw the prosciutto around the fillet, then roll it into a sausage shape, twisting the ends of cling film to tighten it as you go
            Chill the fillet while you roll out the pastry
            Dust your work surface with a little flour. Roll out a third of the 500g pack of puff pastry to a 18 x 30cm strip and place on a non-stick baking sheet</li>
        <li>Roll out the remainder of the 500g pack of puff pastry to about 28 x 36cm
            Unravel the fillet from the cling film and sit it in the centre of the smaller strip of pastry
            Beat the 2 egg yolks with 1 tsp water and brush the pastry’s edges, and the top and sides of the wrapped fillet</li>
        <li>Using a rolling pin, carefully lift and drape the larger piece of pastry over the fillet, pressing well into the sides
            Trim the joins to about a 4cm rim. Seal the rim with the edge of a fork or spoon handle
            Glaze all over with more egg yolk and, using the back of a knife, mark the beef Wellington with long diagonal lines taking care not to cut into the pastry</li>
        <li>Chill for at least 30 mins and up to 24 hrs. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6
            Brush the Wellington with a little more egg yolk and cook until golden and crisp – 20-25 mins for medium-rare beef, 30 mins for medium. Allow to stand for 10 mins before serving in thick slices</li>
